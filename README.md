Tche Foundation is a non-profit entity, with the objective of creating a sustainable and independent ecosystem for teaching, developing, investing
and accelerating projects based on blockchains in Brazil. 

The Foundation's most crucial responsibility is to prepare and train young people, startups and students to develop their technical skills,
products and services, giving them the ability to compete on an equal footing with young people and companies from more developed countries.

The Foundation works to drive adoption and partnerships, to grow the Brazilian developer community, help create legislation and business standards,
and ensure stakeholder accountability at all levels.

To fulfill this role to the highest standards, Tche foundation has a board of directors, a professional executive team and community managers,
recruited in many cases directly from the Brazilian business community, academia and society at large. However, its focus is as much outward as it is inward.
The Foundation is equally committed to working with other key industries within the blockchain domain, contributing to the advancement of technology
and driving adoption with other compatible systems.
The Foundation contributes to the conversation and perception of blockchain locally and globally, with a focus on legal frameworks, integration with legacy
and third-party systems, awareness and education – to ensure that blockchain technology can be accessed, created and understood by all.

The problem.
Brazilians are known for their creative ability, resilience, but we live in a country where entrepreneurship, getting investments and thriving is very difficult. Many large companies establish themselves in Brazilian technology parks, capture intellectual resources, innovative ideas and student projects with research grants and scholarships, but in the end they appropriate the intellectual product or resulting product. Being the creator of the project at the end of the course or scholarship, as an employee or even with nothing.
Getting investment for an idea or even technical and psychological training to have an MVP or even guidance, creating a brand, company, legal advice, accounting is practically a herculean task.

How the project solves.
Tche.Foundation emerges as a hub to provide the Brazilian blockchain ecosystem with a range of non-refundable services, without government involvement or traditional financial entities. Providing a physical space, professionals, content creation studios and courses, development labs, partner development tools, coworking space, psycho-social counseling and preparation, legal, accounting and marketing advice and angel investment for projects presented by society. Brazilian civil and academic
